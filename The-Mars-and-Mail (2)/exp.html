              <a href="#"> <p align="justify">The MOXIE (Mars OXygen In Situ Utilization Experiment) Project is one of the most important Mars-related projects for 2020. It was previously inferred that it is not possible to create oxygen on Mars in an efficient manner, the Mars 2020 Rover (image on left) is putting that theory into question. MOXIE is an experiment which uses a physical model to attempt to create oxygen using carbon dioxide from the soil on Mars. MOXIE’s data can explain an immense amount of information regarding terraforming Mars. Additionally, if the MOXIE experiment yields positive results which indicate that oxygen can really be created, it will change many people’s opinions regarding Musk’s plan. MOXIE attempts to create oxygen in an efficient manner by using a small modular attachment on the Mars 2020 rover which only makes up 1% of its total mass. If the attachment is successful it means that such a complicated task can be done with such a compact design meaning that terraforming Mars can be done faster and more financially sustainable. Although companies and agencies such as SpaceX and NASA have optimal funding terraforming Mars will cause financial stress even to big companies.  The scientific process which will be used by the Mars 2020 rover is called solid oxide electrolysis which involves using methane gas and carbon dioxide to create oxygen. If this process works, it also means that microbial life exists on Mars.
