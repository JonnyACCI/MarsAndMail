              <h3> Boca Chica </h3>
              <p> The development of the cryo-propellant tanks used to power the BFR has begun. The launching and landing coordinates of the upper part (BFS) of the Big Falcon Rocket have been determined. The BFS is planned to be launched attached to the Big Falcon rocket and then detach proceeding  exiting the orbit at  escape velocity. Boca Chica was chosen to improve fuel efficiency, since launching closer to the equator allows for a stronger increase in additional speeds due to the fact that Earth’s rotation add a significant amount of speed to a launch. </p>

As an art     collector, he wants his artists to make art which will reflect on their journey to       add to his collection. He has started supplying a disclosed amount of funding for the    construction of the Big Falcon Rocket which is said to cost $5 billion in total to manufacture.

The test rocket is known as Grasshopper coined from its main function to “hop” between a launching pad and landing pad to a significant height but restricted to not exiting the atmosphere.

              <p> The Mars 2020 Rover is to launch for Mars by July 2020. Its goal is to gather more data on soil on Mars and the atmosphere on Mars. It will have an attachment (1% of total mass) which will attempt to create pure oxygen on Mars using solid oxide electrolysis

Prior to this first launch into orbit, Musk will conduct many test launches before putting people on board.

Once it lands, it will attempt to convert CO2 into oxygen by extracting carbon dioxide from the rock formations and craters on Mars.

              <p> Musk has said that the summer of 2020 is set to be the first BFR trip to Mars, since it is the point in time in which Mars and Earth are quite close so reaching Mars will be about a month faster than the original 6 months. He plans to transport supplies and cargo to Mars which would be used to construct an oxygen-generating station.

              <p> In 2023, the Big Falcon Rocket is to land on Mars full of cargo and supplies. This cargo would be used for building facilities which will generate power, gather water, and extract oxygen. Not only will the facilities be useful for crewed missions, but it will also convert the raw resources on Mars in methane gas and oxygen which is to be used to supply enough fuel for the BFR to return back to Mars. Information from this landing will be used to map safe and optimal landing areas on Mars.

Mars stated on Twitter that the completion of Mars Alpha Base would be the first step to colonising Mars. He also believes that this will open up many entrepreneurial opportunities.
