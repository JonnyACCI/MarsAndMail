            <h3>Musk Does Not Have An Efficient Method to Create Oxygen</h3>

              <a href="#"> <p align="justify">This is quite an interesting factor to discuss, mostly because I did not include this factor for its surface meaning, rather for its hidden meaning. Many would think that the primary reason for the need to create oxygen on Mars is for humans to breathe, but this is not the case. Oxygen has many different purposes for a trip to Mars. There are two very important uses. Firstly, is for humans to breath on Mars, and secondly, when oxygen and methane gas are combined, they can create rocket fuel due to corresponding chemical reactions. This latter use is what this factor is all about. The Big Falcon Rocket is designed to reach Mars quickly, but in turn must have a compact design. Additionally, there is no tanker large enough that could be attached to the BFR which could hold enough fuel to get into Earth’s orbit and then also reach Mars. Musk has already seen this problem and has taken steps to counteract it. This is evident in the architecture of the BFR which is designed to get an extra refill of fuel from a tanker which it carries and then release the tanker back into Earth’s atmosphere where it would navigate back to the launch site. This thoughtful design shows that Musk did consider that getting out of Earth’s orbit alone would require immense amount of fuel and decided to have an on-board tanker. This in itself is already quite an excellent milestone, however, the tanker will only supply enough fuel for the spacecraft to get to Mars. Once it has got to Mars, the BFR will rely on carbon dioxide and methane gas on Mars to create oxygen which when reacted with methane gas would create fuel for the BFR. However, if there is no effective method to create oxygen, the mission is a failed attempt and there would almost be no point in doing it. This is further amplified when a crewed mission is introduced. The BFR would not be able to pass NASA’s certification checks if there is no way to get the crewed spacecraft back to Earth. Musk’s current ideas of nuking Mars and creating a chemical lab are not feasible as to do that, we will need to get humans on Mars first.

            <h3>Cosmic Radiation</h3>
            <img src="https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/Shot_Black-Hole.jpg?itok=hWTUR-5j" class="web-img">
            <div class="text">
              <a href="#"> <p align="justify">Cosmic radiation was a factor which I was introduced to by an article which featured Samantha Rolfe from the University of Hertfordshire. Initially, I did not see radiation as a problem, but after further research on the topic I learned that, it may be one of the biggest problems. Through research, I learned that cosmic radiation is the harmful contact of cosmic rays. Cosmic rays can be explained as beams of atom fragments (consisting of protons and nuclei) which travel through space which are powered by the sun. The path of travel for cosmic rays is really unpredictable which makes them quite hard to engineer for. Although, the problem of cosmic radiation will not lessen the ability to get to Mars, it will make it almost impossible for astronauts to perform tasks on Mars for extended periods of time as they are supposed to like how astronauts such as Niel Armstong and Buzz Aldrin first did when they reached the moon. Similar to the inability to create oxygen on Mars efficiently, Starship will not get the clearance from NASA to be in commision if it cannot sustain astronauts on Mars. Spacesuit technology which keeps astronauts safe during extravehicular activity is non-existent for exposure to Mars terrain and thin atmosphere. Additionally, radiation protection technology is much further behind than aerospace engineering. It may take another 7-10 years before we even have the know-how and engineering design methods to create a spacesuit for Mars. Astronauts will not be able to get onto Mars without having a proper suit for extravehicular activity.

            <h3>Psychological Effects of Such a Long Venture</h3>
            <img src="https://www.readersdigest.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2018/10/psychology-terms-the-research.jpg" class="web-img">
            <div class="text">
              <a href="#"> <p align="justify">Another factor that I was introduced to by Samantha Rolfe’s studies is the psychological effects that will begin to take a toll on an astronaut as they venture to Mars and back. To put this into perspective, the first trip to the Moon and back only took a week, however a trip to Mars and back would take anywhere between 1 year and 1.5 years. This comes with massive psychological effects. In studies done by NASA, it was revealed that crew members overtime became less social and more egocentric. This is known as automonization. Additionally, the lack of living space will cause mental distress. One of the most common impacts on people is the fact that astronauts often return to Earth with some degree of depression as they spend months on months away from loved ones. </p></a>

            <h3>Unrealistic Timeframes</h3>

            <div class="text">
              <a href="#"> <p align="justify">As I discussed in section 4, the timeframes set in place by Musk for completing the BFR, are very unrealistic. This factor is one with much evidence to back it up as when researching this, I related my research to past development of the BFR and additionally other work from SpaceX, specifically the Crew Dragon Project. The Crew Dragon Project saw its first uncrewed launch test in March 2019 which is 3 years since its project initiation, in 2016. This is a very quick development process which has excited many, but this may actually be bad news for the Big Falcon Rocket.  The reason for this possibly indicating bad news is because, Musk finished the manufacturing of an inner-atmospheric spacecraft in three years, which is no easy task, but he then proceeds to also say that he can finish a spacecraft that is meant to reach Mars in three years as well. Through relating the process of making the Big Falcon Rocket to the process of making the Crew Dragon, I was able to find hidden meaning indicating that Musk’s timeline for the manufacturing of the BFR is not feasible.

            <h3>Physiological Effects Of Microgravity</h3>
            <img src="http://www.westerncollege.ca/files/cache/a311217265bb673877d9106e7660add9_f188.jpg" class="web-img">
            <div class="text">
              <a href="#"> <p align="justify">Microgravity is the term used to refer to weak gravity in relation to Earth’s gravity (gravity weaker than earth’s gravity). Microgravity has many negative impacts on the human body as it is much different than Earth’s gravity that astronauts are used to. What does this mean for astronauts? Well, they are required to fulfill two hours of exercise each day. This exercise is meant to maintain bone density and muscle mass. Although, exercise is an effective way to allow astronauts to maintain fitness and strength in space, the effects of microgravity can never fully be negated. There will always be some decrease of bone density and muscle mass when astronauts return to Earth. This decrease is further amplified the more time an astronaut spends in a microgravity environment. A flight to Mars and back including any extravehicular activity the astronauts might complete will take at least two years. This much exposure will result in a harmful decrease in bone density which may leave the astronaut with long-term health effects.
