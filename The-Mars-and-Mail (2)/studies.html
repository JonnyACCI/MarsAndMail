        <h3>Supporting Musk's Idea for </h3> 
        <h3> Producing Oxygen </h3>

              <a href="#"> <p align="justify">Robert M. Zubrin (above image), from Martin Marietta Astronautics and Christopher P. McKay, from the NASA Ames Research Centre published a study regarding the terraforming of Mars in 1993. Although, this way for quite a long time ago, they were able to introduce new ideas which may indicate that Musk’s plan to create oxygen on a large scale on Mars is completely realistic. The first point which they brought up is that Mars once had similar atmospheric and geological features as Earth right now. They state that 21st century technology should be able to “rejuvenate” Mars to a status in which crewed missions would be very easy and efficient. To go into specifics, they mentioned that brute force engineering methods can be used to release enough carbon dioxide into the atmosphere which in turn would thicken the atmosphere reducing the cosmic radiation dose. This argument is contrary to the points brought up by Samantha Rolfe and Tristan Greene. One concern I have with this argument is that if too much carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, at one point, there may be too much carbon dioxide for humans. However, information from the MOXIE experiment may indicate that this carbon dioxide can be converted to oxygen. This would allow for a thickened atmosphere, but also a breathable atmosphere for humans.

        <h3>Against Musk's Methods For </h3>
        <h3> Cosmic Travel </h3>

              <a href="#"> <p align="justify">Samantha Rolfe (image above), an astrobiologist from the University of Hertfordshire and Testan Greene, from The Next Web, analysed the realisticness of Musk’s plan using a different perspective, one dealing with the psychological impacts of travelling to Mars. They state that travelling to Mars will likely present psychological issues to astronauts. Additionally, they also looked at the topic in the perspective of radiation. Due to Mars having such a thin atmosphere and not having its own magnetic field, there is almost no protection from cosmic radiation to those on Mars. Rolfe explained that its not ethical to send astronauts to Mars without sufficient protection from radiation. Although, aerospace engineering is progressing very fast, radiation protection technology is a long way behind. Lastly, they also covered that humans would introduce microbiology to Mars which would likely kill all bacterial life on Mars. This would be negative for science, since these bacteria would be able to reveal quite a bit regarding the history and geology of Mars. This perspective opened up more factors to why Musk’s plan would not work and pose dangers to humans and microbes on Mars.
